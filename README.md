# The Witcher Parallax

### 🗨️ Description

This is a creative landing page featuring a stunning parallax effect based on The Witcher 3 game theme. The project showcases smooth animations and immersive visuals across three main sections, each highlighting different characters from the game world. The parallax effect is achieved using the Swiper.js library, creating a sense of depth and movement as users navigate through the slides. Each section incorporates multiple layers of imagery, including background landscapes, character artwork, and atmospheric particle effects that respond to user interaction. The design maintains the dark, fantasy atmosphere of The Witcher universe while delivering a modern, interactive web experience. This project was created following a tutorial from the [WebDesign Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLbI7BGdQ3o) YouTube channel.
